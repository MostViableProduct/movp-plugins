# User-Scoped Plugin Installation Design

**Date:** 2026-04-08  
**Status:** Approved for implementation planning  
**Repos affected:** `big-wave` (CLI + MCP server), `mona-lisa` (slash command copy)

---

## Context

Today, `movp init` installs the MoVP plugin as project-scoped — creating `.movp/config.yaml` in the current directory and requiring users to run `movp init` in every repository. Users with multiple repos face repeated manual setup.

This design changes the install flow so MoVP is installed once, globally, covering all current and future Claude Code projects.

---

## Goals

1. **User-scoped plugin** — the marketplace plugin (skills, slash commands) loads in every repo without per-repo action.
2. **Lazy project config** — `.movp/config.yaml` is auto-created on first `/movp` command use in a new repo, with the same defaults as today.
3. **One-command setup** — `movp init` authenticates and configures everything globally in two steps.
4. **Backward compatibility** — existing project-level configs are preserved; existing project-scoped installs are migrated.

**Known limitations:**
- Lazy config creation requires `.git` present (file or directory) in the project tree (or `MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT` set explicitly). Non-git workspaces (Mercurial, tarball-only, etc.) will not get auto-created `.movp/config.yaml` without the env override.
- Pre-release installs (`--channel=dev`) pin the plugin to the `next` tag of `movp-plugins`, which is a controlled moving ref (advanced by CI on each pre-release publish). This is an explicit, opt-in developer channel — not recommended for production use.

---

## Architecture

Claude Code manages `installed_plugins.json` automatically. The scope (`"user"` vs `"project"`) is determined by which `settings.json` file contains the `enabledPlugins` entry:

- `~/.claude/settings.json` → `scope: "user"` (loads in all projects)
- `<project>/.claude/settings.json` → `scope: "project"` (loads in that project only)

No code needs to write to `installed_plugins.json` directly. The CLI only needs to write `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins` to `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

## Section 1: Rewritten `movp init`

### New user experience

```
$ npx @movp/cli init

  MoVP CLI v1.0.0

  Step 1/2: Authentication
    ✓ Already authenticated (tenant: abc123...)
    — or —
    Opening browser for device login...
    ✓ Credentials saved

  Step 2/2: Configuring tools
    Claude Code:
      ~/.claude/settings.json → MCP server configured
      ~/.claude/settings.json → marketplace registered (movp@v1.0.0)
      ~/.claude/settings.json → plugin enabled (user-scoped)
    Cursor:
      ~/.cursor/mcp.json → MCP server configured
    Codex:
      ~/.codex/config.toml → MCP server added via codex mcp add

  ✓ MoVP is now active across all your projects.
    Run /movp status in any repo to verify.
```

### Migration output (existing users)

```
  Step 2/2: Configuring tools
    Claude Code: already configured (use --force to create new keys)
    Migrating to user-scoped install...
      ~/.claude/settings.json → marketplace registered (movp@v1.0.0)
      ~/.claude/settings.json → plugin enabled (user-scoped)
      ./Code/my-repo/.claude/settings.json → removed movp@movp from enabledPlugins
      ./Code/my-repo/.claude/settings.json.bak → backup created

  ✓ MoVP is now active across all your projects.
```

### Step ordering

1. Per-tool API setup (unchanged from today — mints keys, writes MCP config)
2. `registerMarketplace()` — writes `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins` to `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. `migrateProjectScoped()` — removes `movp@movp` from project-level `enabledPlugins` in `cwd/.claude/settings.json`

Register before migrate: user-level config is established first. Each file gets a single read-modify-write.

### `registerMarketplace()` — new function in `bin/cli.js`

Calls `mergeJsonConfig(os.homedir(), snippet)` where `snippet.config_json` is:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "movp": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "MostViableProduct/movp-plugins", "tag": "v1.0.0" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "movp@movp": true }
}
```

Tag is derived from CLI `package.json` version:
- Stable release (`1.2.3`): `"v1.2.3"`
- Pre-release (`1.2.3-beta.1` with `--channel=dev`): `"next"`

**`next` tag:** The `movp-plugins` repo maintains a `next` tag (e.g., via a CI step in big-wave that runs `git tag -f next && git push --force origin next` on each pre-release publish). This is a **controlled moving ref** — advanced by the team on each pre-release, not trunk. It is versioned, not `main`.

Pre-release versions require `--channel=dev` to be passed to `movp init`. Without the flag, `init` exits with an error:

    Error: pre-release CLI versions require --channel=dev to install.
    This prevents accidentally pinning your MoVP plugin to the 'next' pre-release channel.
    Re-run: npx @movp/cli@<version> init --channel=dev

With `--channel=dev`, the tag is `"next"` and a loud warning banner is printed:

    ⚠ Channel: dev — plugin pinned to 'next' pre-release channel (not for production use)

`registerMarketplace()` derives `tag = version.includes("-") ? "next" : "v" + version`. The gate lives in `runInit()`: check version before calling `registerMarketplace`.

### `migrateProjectScoped()` — new function in `bin/cli.js`

Scope: **only** `cwd/.claude/settings.json`. No tree walking, no home directory scan.

Steps:
1. Read `cwd/.claude/settings.json`. If absent, return.
2. Check `enabledPlugins["movp@movp"]`. If absent, return.
3. Write backup to `cwd/.claude/settings.json.bak`.
4. Remove only the `"movp@movp"` key from `enabledPlugins`. If `enabledPlugins` is now empty, remove the key.
5. Write updated JSON. Log the relative path and backup path.

Users with project-scoped entries in other repos: those entries are harmless (they won't conflict with the user-level entry). Users can clean them up manually or re-run `movp init` from each repo — one run per repo, scoped to that repo's `cwd/.claude/settings.json`.

### Extended `mergeJsonConfig()` in `lib/helpers.js`

Add `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins` as allow-listed merge keys. Semantics:

- `extraKnownMarketplaces`: replace the `movp` sub-key wholesale (same pattern as `mcpServers.movp`). Do not deep-merge arbitrary nested keys.
- `enabledPlugins`: merge keys from incoming snippet into existing object.
- Same `.bak` creation, `0o600` chmod, and `BLOCKED` key guard as today.

Unit tests: add cases mirroring existing `mergeJsonConfig` coverage for these new key types.

### What's added to `runInit()`

- `--channel=dev` flag — required when running `movp init` with a pre-release CLI version. Add to arg parsing in the `command === "init"` block; pass as `{ channel }` option to `runInit()`. Gate: if `version.includes("-")` and `channel !== "dev"`, exit with error (see pre-release pinning above). If `channel === "dev"`, print a loud `⚠ Channel: dev` banner before calling `registerMarketplace()`.

### What's removed from `runInit()`

- `writeMovpConfig(cwd, noRules)` call (line 949)
- `--no-rules` flag — no longer relevant; remove from arg parsing, help text, and all docs

Grep before shipping: `--no-rules`, `noRules`, `--channel` across both repos and README.

### What's removed from `runInit()` Step 2 label

Changes "Step 1/3 … 2/3 … 3/3" to "Step 1/2 … 2/2".

### `isAlreadyConfigured()` behavior

The "already configured" check only gates API key minting. `registerMarketplace()` and `migrateProjectScoped()` always run, regardless of whether the tool was already configured.

### Partial-failure messaging

If any tool setup fails (`failCount > 0`) or marketplace registration failed, report auth status, marketplace status, and per-tool status independently. Do not print the "active across all projects" success line if failCount > 0 or marketplace registration failed. Print targeted retry guidance instead.

### Messaging accuracy

- "MoVP is now active across all your projects" applies to Claude Code and Cursor (global MCP config). Codex is also machine-wide but via its own config mechanism — copy is accurate for all three.
- Status messages print the actual target file per tool: `~/.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code), `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor), `~/.codex/config.toml` (Codex).

## Section 2: Lazy Project Config Creation

### Problem

With `movp init` no longer creating `.movp/config.yaml`, new repos need project config on first use.

### Trigger

On each inbound JSON-RPC request, the MCP server checks whether `.movp/config.yaml` exists in the resolved project root. If it is missing, it calls `ensureProjectConfig(root)` before forwarding the request to the BFF. Once created, the file exists and subsequent checks are cheap `existsSync` calls that return immediately.

### Project root resolution

Priority order:
1. `MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT` env var — **must be an absolute path to an existing directory**. Validated via `fs.realpathSync` (resolves symlinks; trailing slashes stripped). If set but invalid (not absolute, not a directory, does not exist), fail fast:
   ```
   [movp-mcp] MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT is invalid: "/bad/path" — must be an existing directory.
   ```
2. `process.cwd()` — **only if a `.git` present (file or directory) in `cwd` or any ancestor up to `os.homedir()`**

If neither yields a valid project root (no `.git` found, no env override), skip lazy config creation and log to stderr:

```
[movp-mcp] Could not determine project root — skipping .movp/config.yaml creation.
[movp-mcp] Run MoVP from a git checkout, or set MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/project
[movp-mcp] before starting Claude to enable automatic config creation.
```

Git root detection uses two methods in order:

1. **`execFileSync("git", ["rev-parse", "--show-toplevel"], ...)`** (primary) — uses `child_process.execFileSync` with an explicit argument array (no shell invocation, no injection surface). Options: `{ cwd: startDir, timeout: 500, encoding: "utf8" }`. If this succeeds, use the trimmed result as the project root. Correctly handles git worktrees, nested submodule layouts, and repos with non-standard structures.

2. **`existsSync` walk** (fallback) — used when `execFileSync` throws (non-git directory, `git` not on PATH) or times out. Walk from `startDir` upward checking for a `.git` entry (matches both `.git` **directory** and `.git` **file** for worktrees), stopping at `os.homedir()` or filesystem root.

This ensures worktrees and nested layouts resolve correctly while remaining safe in environments where `git` is unavailable.

### Check per request (no caching flag)

Use `fs.existsSync(path.join(root, ".movp", "config.yaml"))` on each request. No `configEnsured` boolean. The stat call is negligible cost; caching by resolved path introduces fragility if cwd is wrong on the first request.

**MCP root caching:** The MCP server resolves the project root (via `findGitRoot`) once per process lifetime (or when the working directory changes), not on every JSON-RPC message — `git rev-parse` and the `existsSync` walk are cheap but not free, and the resolved root is stable within a session.

### `ensureProjectConfig(root)` — new module

Location: `packages/movp-config/index.js` (as `@movp/config`)

**Rationale:** `lib/helpers.js` is side-effect-free (no FS writes, no logging). `ensureProjectConfig` does both. A separate module preserves that contract.

Exports: `ensureProjectConfig(root)` and the `DEFAULT_PROJECT_CONFIG` / `DEFAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG` constants.

Logic: identical to today's `writeMovpConfig()` minus the `noRules` parameter:
- Create `.movp/config.yaml` if absent (full default content)
- Additive section merge if file exists
- Create `.movp/config.local.yaml` if absent; append `MOVP_FRONTEND_URL` if missing from existing file
- Append `.gitignore` entries idempotently

**Not** in `lib/helpers.js`.

### Package dependency — shared `packages/movp-config`

`packages/mcp-server` must not depend on `packages/cli` — they are independently deployable. The solution is a **shared package** that both depend on:

**`packages/movp-config`** *(new package)* — exports `ensureProjectConfig(root, { log })`, `findGitRoot(startDir)`, `validateProjectRoot(override)`, `DEFAULT_PROJECT_CONFIG`, and `DEFAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG`. No CLI-specific imports. No MCP-specific imports. Pure `fs`/`path`/`os`/`child_process` stdlib.

Both packages declare a workspace dependency:

```json
// packages/cli/package.json
{ "dependencies": { "@movp/config": "workspace:*" } }

// packages/mcp-server/package.json
{ "dependencies": { "@movp/config": "workspace:*" } }
```

`packages/cli/lib/project-config.js` becomes a thin re-export (or is removed; callers import `@movp/config` directly). `packages/mcp-server/index.js` requires `@movp/config` directly:

```js
const { ensureProjectConfig, findGitRoot, validateProjectRoot } = require("@movp/config");
```

`test/mcp-server.test.js` also requires `@movp/config` directly. There is **no `lib/project-root.js`**, no `test-helpers.js`, and no inline copy in `index.js`.

**Parity is structural** — there is one implementation. The golden-fixture tests in `packages/movp-config/test/` verify correctness once; no re-run across packages needed.

**If workspace packages are not viable** (e.g., deployment constraint or build complexity), fall back to `packages/mcp-server/lib/project-root.js` with shared golden-fixture CI as described in the previous revision. Document this tradeoff in the implementation PR.

### Failure behavior

Fail open. If `ensureProjectConfig` throws (permissions error, full disk, invalid YAML during additive merge), log the error to stderr and proceed with the BFF request. Missing `.movp/config.yaml` is a degraded state — the BFF may serve defaults or return an error to the client, but the MCP server itself does not block the request. The stderr warning surfaces the issue.

**BFF contract when `.movp/config.yaml` is absent:**

The BFF **must** behave in one of two documented ways when no `.movp/config.yaml` exists for the current project:

- **Option A (preferred): serve config defaults.** BFF returns HTTP 200 with a response body indicating `"config_source": "defaults"` (or equivalent). The MCP server proceeds normally; tools and skills work with degraded (default) configuration.
- **Option B: return a structured error.** BFF returns HTTP 422 (or similar) with a machine-readable error code (e.g., `"error": "config_missing"`). The MCP server surfaces this as a tool error, not a crash.

**The BFF must not** return HTTP 500 or an unstructured error in this case — that is a BFF bug.

**Before shipping:** Verify which option the BFF implements and add a contract test in `packages/mcp-server/test/mcp-server.test.js` that asserts the actual response shape. The test must record the expected response in a comment so any future BFF change that breaks this contract causes a CI failure. This is Task 8, Step 8.7.

```
[movp-mcp] Warning: could not create .movp/config.yaml: EACCES: permission denied
[movp-mcp] Proceeding without project config. To fix: check directory permissions, or set
[movp-mcp] MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT to a writable project directory.
```

Do not reference `npx @movp/cli init` in this message — `init` no longer creates `.movp/config.yaml`.

### Slash command copy update

In `claude-plugin/commands/status.md` (line 31):
- If credentials are missing: "run `npx @movp/cli login` to authenticate"
- If full setup is needed: "run `npx @movp/cli init` to configure MoVP"

## Verification

1. **Fresh install path:**
   ```
   npx @movp/cli init
   # Verify ~/.claude/settings.json has extraKnownMarketplaces + enabledPlugins
   # Verify ~/.config/movp/credentials exists
   # Start claude in a new repo — verify /movp status loads and .movp/config.yaml is created
   ```

2. **Idempotency:**
   ```
   npx @movp/cli init  # run twice
   # Verify settings.json not corrupted, no duplicate marketplace entries
   ```

3. **Migration:**
   ```
   # Manually add movp@movp to <project>/.claude/settings.json enabledPlugins
   npx @movp/cli init
   # Verify movp@movp removed from project settings, .bak created
   # Verify user-level settings unchanged
   ```

4. **Lazy config:**
   ```
   # Delete .movp/config.yaml from any repo
   # Run /movp review
   # Verify .movp/config.yaml recreated with correct defaults
   # Verify .gitignore updated
   ```

5. **Fail-open:**
   ```
   chmod 000 <project>/.movp/
   # Run /movp review
   # Verify MCP still forwards request, stderr shows warning
   ```

6. **MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT override:**
   ```
   MOVP_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/project claude
   # Run /movp status
   # Verify .movp/config.yaml created at /path/to/project/.movp/config.yaml
   ```

7. **Pre-release gate:**
   ```
   # Simulate pre-release CLI version by temporarily changing package.json version to "1.1.0-beta.1"
   node bin/cli.js init
   # Verify exits with error message referencing --channel=dev
   node bin/cli.js init --channel=dev
   # Verify "⚠ Channel: dev" banner printed, marketplace pinned to 'main'
   ```

8. **BFF contract (no .movp/config.yaml):**
   ```
   # Delete .movp/config.yaml, send JSON-RPC request via MCP server
   # Verify MCP forwards request without blocking
   # Document actual BFF response shape in this section after first run
   ```
